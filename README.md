# Machine-Learning-Traffic-Prediction

Using scikit-learn, this uses the Linear model of Ridge Regression to predict the circumstances of traffic based off of the Freeway, its direction, and the time and day of the week. Ridge Regression was chosen due to its ability to reduce error by adding bias and reducing variance in the given dataset.
